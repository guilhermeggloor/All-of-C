# C language  ! 

 - A course of language C available for free on youtube by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87SH2Cn0s9A&amp;t=11663s
 - it takes 4 hours to watch the full video, so keep calm and watch it carefully 👍
 - I used VsCode to edit files .c, but it have another options like CLion, if you are a student on a university you could keep the license for free 😊.
 - this archives are not organized in topics(sorry) 'cause i used to consult when i am in doubt with something 🤡
 - i suggest you to pickup some exercises and do it after the videos(hands on keyboard !) 🐱‍👤
